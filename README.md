# Akshara-Deepa Tutor - Android App

A self-study companion application for 10th-grade SSLC students designed to help track syllabus, take quizzes, monitor strength, maintain daily learning goals, and access offline study materials.

## Features

### 1. **Syllabus Tracker**
- View complete chapter checklist for Science, Math, and Social Studies
- Mark chapters as complete with progress tracking
- Visual progress bars showing completion percentage
- Subject-wise organization

### 2. **Quiz Mode**
- 5-question daily mock quizzes
- Pre-loaded questions with simulated data (50-100 questions per subject)
- Multiple choice format (A, B, C, D)
- Instant feedback with detailed explanations
- Progress tracking and score calculation

### 3. **Strength Map**
- Visual representation of performance across all subjects
- Color-coded strength indicators (Green: 80%+, Orange: 60-80%, Red: <60%)
- Chapter completion statistics
- Subject-wise performance metrics

### 4. **Daily Goal**
- Set and track daily learning targets
- Visual progress indicator
- Motivational reminders
- Goal completion tracking

### 5. **PDF Study Notes (Offline)**
- Downloadable study notes PDF bundled directly inside the application
- PDF files stored in the Android `assets/study_notes/` folder
- Rendered using the built-in Android `PdfRenderer` API
- Each page converted to a high-resolution Bitmap displayed in a scrollable `LazyColumn`
- **100% offline** — all study materials available once the app is installed
- No internet dependency, critical for rural student accessibility

#### How PDF Rendering Works
```
Your PDF files
      ↓
assets/study_notes/  ← bundled inside APK
      ↓
PdfRenderer API  ← converts pages to Bitmaps
      ↓
LazyColumn + Image composable  ← displays to student
      ↓
100% offline ✅  No internet needed ✅
```

> **Design Decision**: The assets folder approach was chosen over cloud storage solutions (Google Drive, Firebase Storage) to guarantee offline availability regardless of network conditions — which is critical for the rural student target audience.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (Electric Eel or later)
- JDK 8 or higher
- Android SDK (API 34 recommended)

### Installation

1. **Open the project in Android Studio**
   - File > Open > Select the project directory

2. **Sync Gradle**
   - Android Studio should automatically prompt to sync gradle files
   - If not: File > Sync Now

3. **Configure SDK**
   - If SDK is not configured, go to Tools > SDK Manager
   - Install Android SDK Platform 34 and Build Tools 34.0.0

4. **Add PDF Study Notes (if not already present)**
   - Place your PDF files inside `app/src/main/assets/study_notes/`
   - Name them consistently, e.g. `science_ch1.pdf`, `math_ch1.pdf`
   - These are bundled into the APK automatically at build time

5. **Create/Connect Device or Emulator**
   - For testing on an actual device: Enable USB Debugging
   - For emulator: Tools > Device Manager > Create Virtual Device

6. **Build the project**
   - Build > Rebuild Project (or Ctrl+B)

7. **Run the app**
   - Run > Run 'app' (or Shift+F10)
   - Select your device/emulator from the popup

## Key Components

### ViewModels
- **SyllabusTrackerViewModel**: Manages chapter data and progress
- **QuizViewModel**: Handles quiz state and scoring
- **StrengthMapViewModel**: Calculates and displays subject strengths
- **DailyGoalViewModel**: Manages daily learning goals

### Database
- **Room Database**: 5 entities (Chapter, QuizQuestion, QuizAttempt, UserAnswer, Progress)
- **DAOs**: Separate data access objects for each entity
- **Pre-populated Data**: 50+ mock questions across 3 subjects

### UI Screens
- **SyllabusTrackerScreen**: Chapter management with progress bars
- **ChapterDetailScreen**: Topics list, completion stats, and PDF notes access
- **QuizModeScreen**: Question display and answer selection
- **StrengthMapScreen**: Subject performance visualization
- **DailyGoalScreen**: Daily goal tracking and motivation
- **PdfViewerScreen**: Scrollable offline PDF study notes viewer

## Features Implementation Details

### Offline Functionality
- All data is stored locally in Room database
- PDF study notes bundled in `assets/` folder — no download required
- App works 100% offline once installed
- No internet connection required at any point

### PDF Study Notes Implementation
- Uses Android's native `PdfRenderer` API (API 21+, no extra dependency)
- PDFs opened from `assets/` via `AssetManager`
- Each page rendered to `Bitmap` at screen resolution
- Pages displayed in `LazyColumn` using `Image` composable
- Memory-efficient: pages rendered on demand and released after display

### Progress Synchronization
- Progress updates instantly across all screens
- Quiz scores automatically update subject strength map
- Chapter completion reflected in syllabus tracker

### Scoring Algorithm
- Formula: (Correct Answers / Total Questions) × 100
- Scores tracked per attempt
- Average performance calculated per subject

   - Check strength updates
   - Verify color coding

4. **Test Daily Goal**
   - Complete daily goal
   - Verify goal completion animation
   - Reset and try again

5. **Test PDF Study Notes**

   - Tap "Study Notes" to open the PDF viewer
   - Scroll through pages and verify all pages render correctly
   - Enable airplane mode and confirm PDFs still open (offline test)

## Build Variants

- **Debug**: Includes debugging symbols, no minification
- **Release**: Minified, optimized for production

To build release APK:
```bash
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

## Error Troubleshooting

### Gradle Build Issues
```
Solution:
1. File > Invalidate Caches > Invalidate and Restart
2. Delete .gradle folder and rebuild
```

### Database Errors
```
Solution:
1. App uses fallbackToDestructiveMigration
2. Clear app data: Settings > Apps > Akshara-Deepa Tutor > Clear Cache & Data
3. Reinstall app
```

### Compose Issues
```
Solution:
1. Ensure Compose compiler version matches (1.5.3)
2. Update Android Studio to latest version
3. Clear gradle cache
```

### PDF Not Rendering
```
Solution:
1. Confirm PDF file is placed inside app/src/main/assets/study_notes/
2. Check filename matches exactly what is passed to AssetManager (case-sensitive)
3. Verify PdfRenderer is closed properly after use to avoid memory leaks
4. Test on API 21+ device/emulator (PdfRenderer minimum requirement)
```

## Future Enhancements

- Firebase integration for progress sync across devices
- Personalized recommendations based on weak areas
- Timed practice tests
- Analytics dashboard
- Push notifications for daily reminders
- Custom question creation by teachers
- Bookmark and highlight support within PDF viewer
- Text search across study notes
